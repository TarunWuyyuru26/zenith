      "Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that operate with a degree of autonomy, purpose, and self-directed action—essentially, AIs that act as agents in the world. Here are some key points to understand the concept:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Autonomy and Decision-Making: Agentic AI systems are designed to make decisions and take actions based on their interpretation of an environment, goals, or objectives. Unlike simple tools that require explicit, step-by-step instructions, an agentic system can determine the best course of action from a range of possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Goal-Oriented Behavior: These systems typically work toward achieving specific goals. That means they’re not just passive responders to inputs but are engineered to assess circumstances, plan a series of actions, and modify their behavior dynamically to meet objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Independence in Execution: The term “agentic” implies that such systems possess a form of agency—that is, the ability to pursue a course of action independently. Although current AI systems operate under human-defined parameters and constraints, the idea behind agentic AI is that they have a “sense” of purpose that guides their behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Applications and Examples: In practice, examples of early-stage agentic AI might include autonomous vehicles, robotic systems that navigate and perform tasks without constant human intervention, or virtual assistants that proactively manage complex schedules or processes. In research contexts, frameworks like Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and reinforcement learning are used to develop agents that act rationally to maximize their rewards.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Future Considerations: The concept also feeds into discussions about the long-term development of AI. As technology evolves, there is an ongoing debate on how much “agency” an AI should possess and what safety measures need to be implemented when AIs are making decisions that have significant impact on their environment or even society.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, agentic AI is about designing AI systems that not only execute pre-programmed routines but also independently navigate complex tasks and scenarios, making decisions and taking actions that lead toward defined objectives.\n"
